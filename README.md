# PSRS
This repository contains code for assessing Prodromal Synucleinopathy Rating Scale (PSRS) by 1) correlating PSRS ratings with other measures reflecting similar constructs in synucleinopathy phenomenology, and 2) assessing inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the PSRS among NAPS investigators.
## File list
`alpha_across domain.R`: Restructures PSRS data and computes Cronbach's alpha and its confidence intervals for assessing internal consistency across domains.

`ICC.R`: Fits Bayesian ordinal mixed models to compute inter-rater and intra-rater reliability (Bayesian G-coefficients) for PSRS ratings.
